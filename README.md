# Team Profile Generator
  

## Description

The Team Profile Generator is a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. When a team is created, the user is asked to name the team and then proceeds to add the team members. A manager is required and is the first information that is asked. After that the user can select from the following options: Engineer, Intern, or General Employee. Once the user is done adding members, the system generates an HTML with cards for each employee.
